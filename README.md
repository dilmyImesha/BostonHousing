# 🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction App

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment through a Streamlit web application hosted on Streamlit Cloud.


 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s).
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor (best performer)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.
